[Github](https://github.com/Darkflame72/mineweb) [Hosted Client](https://mineweb.glitch.me) [Discord](https://discord.gg/dkke6d9)

A HTML5 Minecraft client that you can run in your browser.

## About

This project was created from the simple idea that we did not want to download minecraft to play it. We wanted the opportunity to be able to play minecraft regardless of the device we are running on so this project is born.

## Have a try

Currently this project is a work in progress so the "stable" version may not be stable and the dev will definetly not be. We have 2 instances currently on glitch for you to enjoy.

## Contributing

To contribute to this project most of our communication happens on our discord server so I recommend joining that. You can either install all packages locally or use the provided dockerfile to run the proxy.

## Software we use

We use several peices of software in order to render and communicate with a minecraft server here they are so we can say thanks.
